= Rust Strings, Explained

== Introduction to &str and String

Why the two types?

How to convert between them?

== Should my function take a String or a &str?

The idiomatic thing to do is take a `&str`.  Examples abound in the stdlib.  

== Should my struct contain a String or a &str?

???

== Splitting

Explain how array destructuring is a more optimal solution, but is currently in nightly and has been for two years...

----
pub struct Dependency {
    org: String,
    name: String,
    rev: String
}

pub fn parse_dependency(dep: &str) -> Result<Dependency, String> {
    let dp = dep.split(':').collect::<Vec<&str>>();
    return match dp.len() {
        3 => Ok(Dependency { org: dp[0].to_string(), name: dp[1].to_string(), rev: dp[2].to_string() }),
        _ => Err("--dependency must be in the format org:name:rev".to_string())
    };
}

----

Explain how the manual cast to Vec<&str> is suboptimal because collect could return any other basic collection type.  Need it for `len()` though?
