= Kotlin Testing Framework
:hp-tags: kotlin

This serves as a rough design document for a Kotlin-based specification framework.  The goal is to provide a rich testing framework unifying beneficial concepts from both Spock and Jasmine.  Spek serves as a good working start for providing an idiomatic Kotlin framework.

== Lifecycle Hooks

Take Spek's concept of `beforeOn` and `afterOn` and generalize it to simply `after` and `before` and allow them to be executed at any scope (e.g. given, on, and it).  A given-scoped `after` is roughly equivalent to JUnit's `@AfterClass` and a on-scoped `after` is roughly equivalent to JUnit's `@After`.  There is no corollary to an it-scoped given in JUnit, though there is in Jasmine.
